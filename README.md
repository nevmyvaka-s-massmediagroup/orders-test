This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using:
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) 
- [Material-ui React](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

Ð¡reated unit tests that verify the sort functionality



## Note

- Also implemented select and selectAll list functionality
- The recommended library (Material) was used and customized
- I chosed material ui styling guide instead SASS in this project, I think this is the most suitable solution, to avoid redundant dependencies.
